# SectorC-case

A (to be) collection of some cases I've made for [SectorC](https://github.com/omkbd/Sector/tree/master/SectorC).

## small

A case in the style of the already designed [SectorD](https://github.com/omkbd/Sector/tree/master/SectorD).
The set contains a top plate (`plate.dxf`) with cutouts for switches and 2.1mm holes which should correspond to the holes on the PCB,
as well as a base (`base.dxf`) with the same 2.1mm holes to be placed underneath the PCB.

Here is a [Twitter photo of `plate.dxf`](https://twitter.com/malpractitioner/status/1308096755666423808/photo/1) to prove that things fit well.

⚠️ Currently the DXF files result in cutting in a pretty random order. I'm working on sequencing them.. hopefully, at some point soon
