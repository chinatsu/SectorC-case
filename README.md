# SectorC-case

A (to be) collection of some cases I've made for [SectorC](https://github.com/omkbd/Sector/tree/master/SectorC).

⚠️ Nothing has been cut yet, there is no guarantee that the files actually produce fitting parts.

## small

A case in the style of the already designed [SectorD](https://github.com/omkbd/Sector/tree/master/SectorD).
The set contains a top plate (`plate.dxf`) with cutouts for switches and 2.1mm holes which should correspond to the holes on the PCB,
as well as a base (`base.dxf`) with the same 2.1mm holes to be placed underneath the PCB.
